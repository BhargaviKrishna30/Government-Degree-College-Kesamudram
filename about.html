  WELCOME TO KAKATIYA UNIVERSITY
</h3>

<p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Kakatiya University was established on 19th August, 1976 to fulfill the aspirations of the Telangana People
  for higher education. It is located in the historical city, Warangal, the erstwhile seat of the Kakatiya rulers.
  The founding of the University was in fact a historic event that heralded a new era in the realm of higher
  education of this region.
  <br><br>
  The erstwhile Post-Graduate Centre of Osmania University was upgraded and named Kakatiya University. The
  University began its journey as PG Centre Warangal in 1968 under the aegis of Osmania University with only
  four Departments viz. Telugu, English, Chemistry and Mathematics. The Departments of Physics, Botany, Zoology,
  Commerce, Public Administration and Economics were added later. The B. Pharmacy course which was started by
  Osmania University in 1974 was shifted to KU in 1975.
